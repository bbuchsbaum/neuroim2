\title{Create a resampled spherical searchlight iterator}
\usage{
resampled_searchlight(mask, radius = 8, iter = 100)

bootstrap_searchlight(mask, radius = 8, iter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{mask}{A \code{\linkS4class{NeuroVol}} object representing the brain mask.}

\item{radius}{A numeric scalar or vector specifying candidate radii (in voxel
units) for the searchlight sphere. If a vector is supplied, a radius is
sampled uniformly (with replacement) for each searchlight. All radii must
be positive. Default is 8.}

\item{iter}{An integer specifying the total number of searchlights to sample.
Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A \code{deferred_list} object containing \code{\linkS4class{ROIVolWindow}}
  objects, each representing a spherical searchlight region sampled from within the mask.
}
\description{
This function generates a spherical searchlight iterator by sampling regions
from within a brain mask. It creates searchlight spheres around randomly
selected center voxels (with replacement), allowing the same center and
surrounding voxels to appear in multiple samples. Each searchlight can also
draw its radius from a user-specified set of radii.
}
\details{
Searchlight centers are sampled with replacement, so the same center (and its
surrounding voxels) can be selected multiple times. When multiple radii are
provided, each searchlight independently samples one radius from the supplied
values.
}
\examples{
# Load an example brain mask
mask <- read_vol(system.file("extdata", "global_mask_v4.nii", package="neuroim2"))

# Generate a resampled searchlight iterator with radii drawn from {4,6,8}
searchlights <- resampled_searchlight(mask, radius = c(4, 6, 8))
