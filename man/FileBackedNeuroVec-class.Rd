\title{FileBackedNeuroVec Class}
\description{
A class representing a four-dimensional brain image that uses on-demand loading
through memory-mapped file access. This approach enables efficient handling of
large-scale brain imaging data by loading only the required portions of the data
into memory when needed.
}
\details{
FileBackedNeuroVec objects provide a memory-efficient solution for working with
large 4D neuroimaging datasets. By utilizing memory-mapped file access, this class
allows users to work with datasets that exceed available RAM, only loading the
necessary data segments into memory as they are accessed.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{meta}}{An instance of class \code{\linkS4class{FileMetaInfo}} containing
file metadata such as file path, format, and other associated information.}
}}

\section{Inheritance}{

\code{FileBackedNeuroVec} inherits from:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\linkS4class{NeuroVec}}: Base class for 4D brain images
  \item \code{ArrayLike4D}: Interface for 4D array-like operations
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a FileBackedNeuroVec object
file_path <- "/path/to/large/brain/image.nii.gz"
file_meta <- FileMetaInfo(file_path, format = "NIFTI")
file_backed_vec <- FileBackedNeuroVec(meta = file_meta)

# Access a subset of the data (this will load only the required portion)
subset <- file_backed_vec[,,, 1:10]
}
