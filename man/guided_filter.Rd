\title{Edge-Preserving Guided Filter for Volumetric Images}
\usage{
guided_filter(vol, radius = 4, epsilon = 0.7^2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vol}{A \code{\linkS4class{NeuroVol}} object representing the image volume to be filtered.}

\item{radius}{An integer specifying the spatial radius of the filter. Default is 4.}

\item{epsilon}{A numeric value specifying the regularization parameter. It controls
the degree of smoothing and edge preservation. Default is 0.49 (0.7^2).}
}
\value{
A \code{\linkS4class{NeuroVol}} object representing the filtered image.
}
\description{
This function applies a guided filter to a volumetric image (3D brain MRI data)
to perform edge-preserving smoothing. The guided filter smooths the image while
preserving edges, providing a balance between noise reduction and structural preservation.
}
\details{
The guided filter operates by computing local linear models between the guidance
image (which is the same as the input image in this implementation) and the output.
The 'radius' parameter determines the size of the local neighborhood, while 'epsilon'
controls the smoothness of the filter.

The implementation uses box blur operations for efficiency, which approximates
the behavior of the original guided filter algorithm.

\examples{
# Load an example brain volume
brain_vol <- read_vol(system.file("extdata", "global_mask_v4.nii", package = "neuroim2"))

# Apply guided filtering to the brain volume
\dontrun{
filtered_vol <- guided_filter(brain_vol, radius = 4, epsilon = 0.49)

# Visualize a slice of the original and filtered volumes
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
image(brain_vol[,,12], main = "Original")
image(filtered_vol[,,12], main = "Filtered")
}
