\usage{
slices(x, ...)

\S4method{slices}{NeuroVol}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A NeuroVol object}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the underlying methods}
}
\value{
A list of 2D matrices, each containing a slice from the input object

A deflist object containing functions that return 2D slices of the volume along the z-axis.
        The length of the deflist equals the number of slices in the z dimension.
}
\description{
This function extracts an ordered series of 2D slices from a 3D or 4D object. The returned slices are in the order they appear in the original object.
