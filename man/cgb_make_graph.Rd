\arguments{
\item{runs}{A \code{\linkS4class{NeuroVec}} or a list of \code{NeuroVec}
objects (typically one per run).}

\item{mask}{Optional \code{\linkS4class{LogicalNeuroVol}}/\code{NeuroVol} or
logical array defining in-mask voxels. Defaults to all in-mask voxels.}

\item{window}{Integer half-width of the cubic spatial neighborhood
(e.g., \code{1} yields a \(3\times3\times3\) window).}

\item{spatial_sigma}{Spatial Gaussian sigma in mm.}

\item{corr_map}{Mapping from pooled correlation to affinity; one of
\code{"power"}, \code{"exp"}, or \code{"soft"}. The \code{"power"} and
\code{"soft"} mappings rectify negative correlations, whereas
\code{"exp"} preserves them (useful for sharpening more than smoothing).}

\item{corr_param}{Parameter for the chosen \code{corr_map}
(gamma, tau, or r0 respectively).}

\item{topk}{Keep the strongest \code{k} neighbors after masking (0 keeps all).}

\item{leave_one_out}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} and multiple runs are provided,
returns a list of graphs where run \code{u} excludes its own correlations.}

\item{run_weights}{Optional numeric weights per run used in Fisher-z pooling.
Defaults to \eqn{n_k - 3} (usable frames minus three) when omitted.}

\item{add_self}{Logical; always inject a tiny self-edge before normalization.}

\item{time_weights}{Optional list (or single vector) of per-run time weights
\eqn{w_t \in [0,1]} applied before correlation estimation. An intercept is
always included so correlations are computed on weighted, demeaned series.}

\item{confounds}{Optional list (or single matrix) of per-run confound
regressors to project out prior to correlation estimation.}

\item{robust}{One of \code{"none"}, \code{"huber"}, or \code{"tukey"}; when
not \code{"none"} an additional DVARS-style reweighting is applied.}

\item{robust_c}{Tuning constant for the robust weights (Huber/Tukey).}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{row_ptr}, \code{col_ind}, \code{val},
  \code{dims3d}, and \code{mask_idx}, or (if \code{leave_one_out=TRUE})
  a list of such graphs.
}
\description{
Computes a sparse row-stochastic graph whose weights combine spatial proximity
and pooled local time-series correlations. Supports optional censoring weights,
nuisance regression via weighted QR projectors, leave-one-run-out graph
construction, and robust down-weighting of high-DVARS volumes.

\details{
Graph construction overview:
- Neighborhood: For each in-mask voxel i, consider a cubic spatial window of
  half-width \code{window} (i.e., (2*window+1)^3 candidates). Candidates
  outside the mask or bounds are ignored.
- Spatial kernel: For a candidate j at physical distance d_ij (mm), assign a
  spatial weight w_s = exp(-d_ij^2 / (2 * spatial_sigma^2)). Distances use
  \code{spacing(spatial_space)}.
- Correlation pooling: Compute Pearson correlation r_k(i,j) within each run k
  (optionally after nuisance projection/weights), transform to Fisher-z,
  pool across runs with weights \eqn{\omega_k} (default \eqn{n_k - 3}), then
  back-transform to r_pool via tanh.
- Correlation-to-affinity mapping (\code{corr_map}):
  * \code{"power"} (mode=0): a(r) = r^gamma for r>0 else 0. Parameter = gamma.
  * \code{"exp"} (mode=1): a(r) = exp(- (1 - r)^2 / (2 * tau^2)). Parameter = tau.
  * \code{"soft"} (mode=2): a(r) = max(r - r0, 0). Parameter = r0.
- Combined weight: w_ij = w_s(i,j) * a(r_pool(i,j)). If \code{topk > 0}, keep
  the strongest \code{topk} neighbors. Optionally inject a small self-edge
  when \code{add_self=TRUE}. Finally, row-normalize to obtain a stochastic W.

Parameter guidance:
- \code{spatial_sigma} is in mm. A typical choice is 1–2× the voxel size
  (e.g., 2–4 mm for 2 mm isotropic). Larger values increase spatial mixing.
- \code{window} controls support; a good rule is
  \code{ceiling(2 * spatial_sigma / min(spacing))}.
- \code{corr_map}: use \code{"power"} with \code{corr_param = 2} for robust
  smoothing; \code{"exp"} with \code{tau ~ 0.5–1.5} retains sign information;
  \code{"soft"} with \code{r0 ~ 0.1–0.3} thresholds weak correlations.
- \code{topk}: 8–32 is a practical range; higher values densify the graph and
  increase compute/memory.
- \code{leave_one_out}: for multi-run inputs, enabling this prevents a run
  from using its own correlations when building its graph (mitigates leakage).

Nuisance/time weights/robust options:
- If \code{confounds}/\code{time_weights} specified (or \code{robust != "none"}),
  per-run weighted QR projectors are used; correlations are computed on the
  projected, weighted series. Robust options add DVARS-like down-weighting.
- If the only request is an implicit intercept (no actual confounds, no time
  weights, no robust), the baseline builder is used for identical results.

Output and usage:
- Returns CSR arrays (\code{row_ptr}, \code{col_ind}, \code{val}) that define
  a row-stochastic matrix W over masked voxels. Apply with \code{cgb_smooth}.
- Complexity scales with number of masked voxels times neighborhood size
  (limited by \code{topk}). Memory proportional to number of retained edges.
