\description{
This method performs arithmetic operations between two SparseNeuroVol objects (\code{e1} and \code{e2}) using a generic arithmetic function.
The dimensions of both objects are checked for compatibility before performing the operation.

This method performs arithmetic operations between two ROIVol objects (\code{e1} and \code{e2}) using a generic arithmetic function.
The dimensions of both objects are checked for compatibility before performing the operation.

Perform an arithmetic operation between two SparseNeuroVec objects.
The input SparseNeuroVec objects must have the same dimensions and NeuroSpace objects.
The method computes the union of the masks and performs the arithmetic operation
on the non-zero values. The result is returned as a new SparseNeuroVec object.

Perform an arithmetic operation between a SparseNeuroVol object and a NeuroVol object.
The input SparseNeuroVol and NeuroVol objects must have the same dimensions.
The method performs the arithmetic operation on the non-zero values of the SparseNeuroVol
and the corresponding values of the NeuroVol. The result is returned as a new DenseNeuroVol object.
