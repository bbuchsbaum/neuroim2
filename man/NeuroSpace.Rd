\usage{
NeuroSpace(dim, spacing = NULL, origin = NULL, axes = NULL, trans = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{An integer vector describing the dimensions of the image grid.}

\item{spacing}{A numeric vector representing the real-valued voxel dimensions 
(e.g., in millimeters). If not provided, defaults to a vector of ones with 
the same length as `dim`.}

\item{origin}{A numeric vector representing the coordinate origin of the image space. 
If not provided, defaults to a vector of zeros with the same length as `dim`.}

\item{axes}{An \code{\linkS4class{AxisSet}} object representing the image axes ordering. 
If not provided, the default axes are determined based on the NIFTI standard 
(Left-Posterior-Inferior for 3D, or LEFT_RIGHT and POST_ANT for 2D).}

\item{trans}{A matrix representing the coordinate transformation associated with 
the image space. If not provided, a default transformation is constructed based 
on the spacing and origin.}
}
\value{
An instance of the \code{\linkS4class{NeuroSpace}} class.
}
\description{
This function constructs a NeuroSpace object, which defines the spatial properties
of a neuroimaging volume, including its dimensions, origin, spacing, axes, and 
coordinate transformation.
}
\details{
The function performs several checks and computations:
\itemize{
  \item It ensures that `spacing` and `origin` have appropriate lengths and values.
  \item If `trans` is not provided, it constructs a default transformation matrix.
  \item It determines the appropriate axis set if not provided.
  \item It creates a NeuroSpace object with the specified or computed properties.
}

The resulting NeuroSpace object encapsulates all the spatial information necessary 
to interpret and manipulate neuroimaging data.
}
\note{
Users rarely need to create a new \code{NeuroSpace} instance directly, as it will 
almost always be created automatically using information stored in an image header. 
If an existing image object is available, its \code{NeuroSpace} instance can be 
easily extracted with the \code{space} method.

\examples{
# Create a 3D NeuroSpace object
bspace_3d <- NeuroSpace(c(64, 64, 64), origin = c(0, 0, 0), spacing = c(2, 2, 2))
print(bspace_3d)
cat("Origin:", origin(bspace_3d), "\n")
cat("Axes:", axes(bspace_3d), "\n")
cat("Transformation matrix:\n")
print(trans(bspace_3d))

# Create a 2D NeuroSpace object
bspace_2d <- NeuroSpace(c(128, 128), spacing = c(1.5, 1.5))
print(bspace_2d)
