# Brain Time-Series HDF5 File Format Specification (Final Revision)
#
# This YAML document specifies the structure of a brain time-series file format based on HDF5.
# The format includes a header resembling the NIfTI-1 header, a binary mask, a cluster index map,
# voxel coordinates, cluster metadata, and time-series data for each scan, organized by clusters.
# Detailed explanations and alignment instructions are embedded within the YAML structure for clarity.
