# neuroim2 0.8.3

* 4D bilateral filter now measures intensity variance across all timepoints in the mask and skips non-finite neighbours, eliminating spurious NaNs on constant or noisy inputs.
* Added regression tests covering the zero-window identity and constant-volume stability for the parallel 4D bilateral filter backend.
* New `meta_info()` helper returns a normalized list of basic header metadata from a filename or `FileMetaInfo` (dim, spacing, origin, trans, path, etc.), making 3D/4D image introspection simpler for new users.

# neuroim2 0.8.2

* README refreshed: CRAN/R-universe install, CI/coverage badges, website & cheatsheet links.
* Docs: `spherical_roi()` now cross-links to `spherical_roi_set()`; ROI vignette shows multi-ROI creation.
* SparseNeuroVec:
  - New validity checks to catch data/mask/space shape mismatches (#5).
  - Robust `as.matrix.SparseNeuroVec()` implementation (#2).
* New `resample_to()` wrapper for readable interpolation names; delegates to existing `resample()` methods.


# neuroim2 0.8.1

* Initial CRAN submission.
